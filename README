# Easy Osc3++

The space is defined by combinations of oscillation parameters defined inside **Cards**.
For each point of the oscillation parameter space, a set of histograms is created and oscillated with those oscilliation parameters.
Two sets are available: *HKDR* and *Asimov A*, labelled repectively `hkdr` and `asim`.

Two main executables from *Osc3++* are used: ```GlobalOsc``` and ```GlobalSpaghettiSensitivity```.
The first one prepares the fitting space and oscillates the distributions,
the second one makes a fit for each of the points of the space vs a *true* point.

In exectuing the following scripts, the structure of the folder is important.
I will refer as ```global``` paths where the files to be fitted are created, i.e. the outputs of ```GlobalOsc```, and as ```root``` to where the outputs of the fit is, i.e. the outputs of ```GlobalSpaghettiSensitivity```


## Creating the fitting space

The first step is to create the fitting space, by running ```GlobalOsc```.
This can be done with the follwing script:
```
./global.sh [-i | -n] -f nFiles -g /path/to/global
```
where ```-i``` or ```-n``` select inverted or normal hiereachy for the oscillation.


## Prepare the systematics

```
./prepare_systematics.sh /path/to/root matrix1.root matrix2.root
```

# Run the fit

```
./sensitivity.sh -g /path/to/global -r /path/to/root -1 mh1 -2 mh2
```

Once it is done, contours can be created, after adding penalty terms
```
./contour.sh -g /path/to/global -r /path/to/root -1 mh1 -2 mh2
```

# Create usefule plots

```
./contour.sh -g /path/to/global -r /path/to/root -1 mh1 -2 mh2
```
